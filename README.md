#  üåç Visualizing Climate Change Effects on Tree Health
An interactive web application that demonstrates the impact of greenhouse gas levels on tree health. Using dynamic images and a slider control, users can observe how increasing concentrations of gases like CO‚ÇÇ, N‚ÇÇO, CH‚ÇÑ, and NO‚Çì affect the phases of tree decomposition. This project aims to raise awareness about climate change and educate users on the detrimental effects of air pollution.

### Live Demo

Check out the live version of this project here: [Climate Change Visualization Live](https://climate-opal.vercel.app)
## üöÄ Features

- **Slider Control:**: Users can adjust gas levels between 0 ppm and 1000 ppm to simulate real-world gas concentrations.
- **Tree Health Visualization:**: Seven images representing different phases of tree decomposition dynamically update as gas levels change.
- **Educational Feedback:**:  Provides real-time feedback on the gas concentration level, phase of tree decomposition, and the impact on tree health.
- **Responsive Design:**:The application is fully responsive and works across different devices and screen sizes.
## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **TypeScript:**: Adds type safety and improves code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **Vite:**: For fast and optimized development builds.
